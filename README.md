# Image Quant - Entity Retrieval from Product Images for Digital Markets

## Introduction
**Image Quant** is a machine learning solution designed to extract critical entity values (e.g., weight, volume, voltage) from product images in digital markets. This project combines advanced computer vision techniques, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), to build a robust model capable of predicting accurate values and their respective units from product images.

## Problem Statement
The goal of the project is to create a model that extracts and predicts entity values and units from product images in industries like e-commerce, healthcare, and content moderation. Due to the lack of detailed textual descriptions for many products, extracting information directly from images is crucial for providing accurate and comprehensive data.

## Literature Review
Various studies and models have been developed to extract information from images. The use of CNNs for feature extraction, combined with OCR for text recognition, has shown promising results in similar problems. However, challenges such as varied image quality, complex text layouts, and multiple entities in a single image require a hybrid approach.
